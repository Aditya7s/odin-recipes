    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Falafel is a delicious and satisfying dish that consists of deep-fried balls of seasoned chickpea mixture, served with pita bread and various toppings. 
        Making falafel at home is not difficult, but it does require some planning and preparation. The key to crispy and fluffy falafel is to use dried chickpeas that are soaked in water for 24 hours, 
        rather than canned ones. This will give the falafel a coarser texture and more starchiness, which will help them hold together in the hot oil.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make the falafel mixture, you will need a food processor to mince the onion, garlic, herbs, spices, flour, and baking powder. Then, you will pulse the soaked chickpeas until they form a coarse paste. 
        You will refrigerate the mixture for at least 15 minutes to let it rest and firm up. Next, you will shape the mixture into small balls and fry them in batches in oil that is heated to 350°F. 
        You will cook them until they are golden-brown and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. Finally, you will serve them with pita bread, tzatziki or tahini sauce, 
        tomato cucumber salad, feta cheese, lemon wedges, and any other toppings you like. Enjoy your homemade falafel!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces of dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>cold water</li>
        <li>half a yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 or 6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh parsley and cilantro</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of ground cumin</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>3 or 4 tablespoons of flour (all-purpose or chickpea)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>Pita Bread</li>
        <li>Tzatziki or tahini sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato cucumber salad</li>
        <li>Feta cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Completely submerge and soak dry chickpeas in cold water for 24 hours. Next step you will need a food processor.
        For every 8 ounces of chickpeas, you should start by first processing half a yellow onion and 5 or 6 garlic cloves.
        Once you mince the onions and garlic (independently), take them out of the food processor and add in your soaked chickpeas.
        Pulse the soaked chickpeas in the food processor until they form a course mixture. Then, add a handful of fresh herbs such as parsley and cilantro, a couple of teaspoons of ground cumin,
        cayenne or paprika for some spiciness, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Then add the minced onion and garlic back in and pulse the ingredients in the processor
        altogether. Next you will need a little bit of flour (around 3-4 tablespoons) to keep everything held together alongside one teaspoon of baking powder.
        Then roll the mixture into little balls, about golf ball sized, and throw them into the fridge for 15 minutes to an hour. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the mixture has rested, you can deep fry them. They can be deep fried in a cast iron skillet or a Dutch oven.
        You'll need about an inch of any oil with a high smokepoint, such as canola, grapeseed, or vegetable, and bring its temperature to around 350<sup>&deg;</sup>F. Once the oil is at the temperature,
        get a sheet pan lined with paper towels and put it next to the station. Next, using a slotted spoon, gently lower the falafel balls into the hot oil and let it cook until golden brown.
        Then take the falafel out of the oil and onto the paper towels to get any excess oil out and give them a sprinkle of salt.
