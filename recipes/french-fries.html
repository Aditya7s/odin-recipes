        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            If you love seasoned fries but don’t want to spend too much on store-bought ones or deep-fry them at home, this recipe is for you. You can make your own crispy and flavorful fries with just a few ingredients and some simple steps. All you need are some russet potatoes, flour, water, and seasonings. You’ll slice the potatoes and soak them in cold water to prevent browning, then make a batter with flour, water, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt. You’ll dip the potato slices in the batter and fry them in hot oil until golden and crisp. You’ll enjoy these fries as a snack or a side dish with your favorite dipping sauce.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water (or as needed)</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut potatoes into thin slices (about 1/4 inch thick). Place them in a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, sift together flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt. Gradually stir in water until the mixture is smooth and thin enough to coat the potato slices.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain and dry the potato slices with paper towels. Dip them in the batter and shake off any excess. Carefully drop them into the hot oil, one at a time, and fry until golden and crisp, turning once, about 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Do not overcrowd the skillet.</li>
            <li>Drain the fries on paper towels and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!</li>
